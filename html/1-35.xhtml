            <h1>Of <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person51">the same</a> to
                <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person2402">Eustace the presbyter</a>.</h1>
            
            <h2>From those during episcopacy, from the 7th book the
                140th, and 142nd letter.</h2>
            
            <p> When I had read the letter of your love of God, I was desirous of carrying out what
                you ask and begging <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person2245">Jesus</a>, who is God, to
                bestow the ordination of a deacon upon the devout brother <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person2400">John</a> through my sinful and unworthy hand. But I was
                greatly opposed in this and my readiness hindered by the strictness of the canons,
                which do not on any other condition allow a man who has been afflicted with the yoke
                of slavery to enter the sacred clergy unless he has received manumission and removed
                from him the bond of slavery. This principle was in fact observed by Peter who is
                among the saints, <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person680">the bishop</a> from <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place2674">Iberia</a>, a man who in all things acted in accordance
                with the judgments of God. When <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person2401">father
                    Timothy</a>, an inmate of what is called <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place2653">the
                        convent of Majuma</a>, had been approved for admission to the
                presbyterate, he would not on any other condition allow him to receive ordination,
                unless those who were thought to be his masters had first bestowed freedom upon him:
                and then the God-loving presbyter <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person2540">father
                    Theodore</a> went with him and had the legal forms of manumission carried
                out in <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place2626">the church called that of Anthedon</a>.
                For the monastery that is being built by your religiousness, and by help from God
                is
                on the  point of being finished, we have sent you a very small present:
                which please receive contentedly: since the holy church here, having been laden with
                many debts by him who was ejected, does not allow me to show munificence or
                liberality even in urgent matters. Our common Christ-loving brother the lord
                <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person2403">Genesius</a> we received with joy, and we
                offered him all that was in our power, seeing he is a man who deserves any trouble
                or
                effort. </p>
            
            <p>The end.</p>
